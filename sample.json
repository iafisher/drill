      "answer": "The late medieval period in England was an era of domestic turmoil and recurring war abroad in France. Beginning in the reign of the unstable Henry VI of the House of Lancaster, the legitimacy of the Lancastrian monopoly on the throne was challenged by the rival claimants of the House of York. Henry VI was ultimately deposed, twice, by Edward IV of the House of York. Edward IV's son, Edward V, ruled only briefly before being overthrown and presumably murdered by Richard III, another Yorkist. Richard III ruled for only two years before dying in battle against Henry Tudor at Bosworth Field. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII and inaugurated the new Tudor dynasty, which would rule England for much of the early modern period."
